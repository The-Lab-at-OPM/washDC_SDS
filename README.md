Summer Design School is a week-long workshop created by The Lab at OPM that experiments with new ways of teaching, learning, and applying human-centered design in the public sector. We will look at complex challenges through a series of different frames, with an emphasis on understanding why, when, and how to apply design thinking to projects.

We're looking forward to a great week and hope you can join us!
